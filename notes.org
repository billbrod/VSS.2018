* VSS 2018 poster notes

 - pRF plot:
   - the y-axis is the sigma of a Gaussian fit (so the radius of one
     sigma, probably equivalent to half the line from Freeman and
     Simoncelli, 2011)
   - the center line is the best fit to the data, and then the error
     slope is the fit to the residuals, so that the region spanned is
     basically the middle 50% of the data.
   - line only fit to data that went out to 6 degrees (they had data
     out to 8 degrees, but started to see weird edge effects)
   - this is the "allfits" data, which is the fit to all subjects from
     the HCP 7T retinotopy data (181 healthy subjects, 1.6mm voxels)
 - final period plot:
   - we're showing the diameter of 2 standard deviations, which is
     0.25394 * ecc + .1
   - this gives us then the following # of periods per 2 std dev (this
     is the ratio of their slopes):
     - circular: 1.489194
     - radial: 1.91291
     - forward spiral: 2.080483
     - reverse spiral: 2.142731
